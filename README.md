# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Name

## News API Key Setup

To use the News API in this project, you'll need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps:

## Create a News API

1. **Create a News API Account:**

   - Go to [News API website](https://newsapi.org/) and create an account.

2. **Obtain API Key:**

   - Log in to your News API account.
   - Navigate to the "API Keys" section or a similar area in your dashboard.
   - Generate a new API key.

3. **Add API Key to Your Project:**

   - Open the `config.js` file (or another relevant file) in your project.
   - Replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key you obtained.

4. **Security Considerations:**

   - Keep your API key secure. Avoid exposing it in public repositories.
   - Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration method to store and access the API key.

5. **Example Code:**
   ```javascript
   // config.js
   const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
   export default API_KEY;
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
